# Olympic Data Analysis: Decoding the Medal Games üèÖüìä

Welcome to my Olympic data analysis project, where I've delved deep into the fascinating realm of the Olympics. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to Olympic success, as measured by medal counts in relation to economic and demographic indicators.

## Project Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Importation

We began by importing three critical CSV datasets representing Summer, Winter, and a reference dictionary. Merging the Summer and Winter datasets, we introduced a new 'Edition' column to distinguish between the games.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Null Value Management and Data Cleaning

Ensuring data integrity, we addressed missing entries in the 'code' column and filled in missing country data using mapping functions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Merging and Population Analysis

We combined the main dataset with the dictionary, cross-referencing populations and GDP per capita for each country.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values Post-Merge

To enrich our dataset, we retrieved additional data for countries lacking population and GDP information using a chatGPT and Google Bard.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Enrichment

Leveraging artificial intelligence and meticulous research, we augmented missing values to enhance dataset completeness.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Data Cleaning

Focused on recognized countries, we excluded teams not affiliated with the National Olympic Committee (NOC) and 'mixed teams.'

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization and Analysis

We identified and visually presented the top 10 countries by medal count, distinguishing between Summer and Winter Editions. We compared top-performing countries, spotlighting medal tallies.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Research Question and Correlation Analysis

Delving deep, we explored the correlation between GDP, population, and medal count, validating hypotheses through statistical models.

## Edition Matters

The edition of the Olympics can have a significant impact on the results. Factors like the addition of new sports, changes in rules, and geopolitical events can influence medal counts.

## Gender Matters

Gender equality in the Olympics has been a growing concern. The inclusion of more women's events and efforts to promote gender balance have shaped the competition over the years.
